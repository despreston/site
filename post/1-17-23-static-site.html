    <h1>An alternative to static site generators</h1>
    <time>January 17, 2023</time>
    <p>
    Up until a week ago this site was created with the help of the static site generator <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>.
    That worked decently for a year or so, but every time I would come back to write something after
    a long break I'd need to reread the docs to do absolutely anything.
    </p>
    <p>
    I'd like to offer <a href="https://github.com/despreston/site">my alternative</a> to Hugo,
    Jekyll, et al. It's called, HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
    All my content is written in plain html. I use a bash script that takes two inputs: file name
    and title, and generates a new file based on a little HTML template.
    </p>
    <p>
    Styling is a done with a single CSS file.
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>Some downsides, maybe?</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>HTML takes slightly longer to write than markdown. Although maybe not since I'm always forgetting markdown syntax.</li> 
      <li>Need to manually add a link to the post in index.html. Could probably automate this at some point.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    We'll see how long this lasts.

    <h1>Backing up vimwiki with rsync</h1>

    I use vimwiki to take notes and keep a todo list. Vimwiki stores every page as a separate
    markdown file in whatever directory you tell it to use. For a long time, my backup strategy for
    my vimwiki files was Dropbox. Dropbox always seemed like a heavy-handed solution for essentially
    a dozen text files and I’ve wanted to switch to something simpler for a while. Dropbox is not an
    approved piece of software at my new job, so that also accelerated my search for a new backup
    solution.

    I ended up using rsync with a raspberry pi I keep running 24/7. Because rsync needs to be
    manually triggered, there’s a bunch of additional tools out there that essentially watch your
    files for changes and then trigger rsync. Instead of that, I added this to my vimrc:
    </p>
    <pre>
    " after saving anything in ~/vimwiki, sync to rpi for backup
    au! BufWritePost ~/vimwiki/* silent
      \ execute "!rsync -avz ~/vimwiki/ des-pi:/home/des/vimwiki" |
      \ redraw!
    </pre>
    <p>
    In english, whenever a file in my vimwiki directory is written to, it’ll run rsync. This sends
    my changes to the rpi as soon as I hit save.

    <h1>Deno thoughts</h1>
    <time>April 30, 2021</time>
    <p>
    I recently converted a ~150 SLOC Node project I run in AWS Lambda to Deno (https://deno.land).
    Deno’s been around for a year or so and seems stable at this point; especially for a 150 line
    hobby project. Below are some notes I wrote about my experience.
    </p>
    <strong>The best parts of typescript</strong>
    <p>
    Typescript + Node require some additional steps in order to get setup. With Deno, Typescript is
    built in and is a first-class component in the Deno ecosystem. It’s no surprise half of the top
    comments in this thread titled, “Starting a Typescript Project in 2021” are recommendations for
    Deno. There is no “npm install …” or build scripts to add to your package.json. Install Deno,
    write some TS, run “deno run mycode.ts” or even “deno run –watch mycode.ts” — no need to install
    nodemon — and you’re set.
    </p>
    <p>
    Deno uses the Rust-based swc TS compiler. Related Deno Issue about Switching. It is fucking
    fast, plain and simple. It feels like working on a Go project with respect to compile times.
    </p>
    <strong>Tooling is fast</strong>
    <p>
    The linter, formatter, and language server are all written in Rust, which, compared to their
    most popular Node counterparts, are wayyy faster.
    </p>
    <strong>Built-in tooling</strong>
    <p>
    All the above-mentioned tools that every Node developer ends up npm installing into every
    repo all come packaged with Deno’s single binary. Having everything come packaged as one binary
    is one of things I love about Go. Creating a .ts file for a small project without having to
    setup npm and install 4-5 packages is fantastic. Deno comes with a linter, formatter, REPL,
    language server, test runner, bundler, compiler (to ship binaries), coverage reporter, and a
    docs generator. You can even view docs online for any package at https://doc.deno.land.
    </p>
    <strong>Standardized code style</strong>
    <p>
    Controversial, but one of the things I love the most about Go is that every repo on the internet
    looks the same. Deno’s formatter formats code using the same rules for everyone, and I think
    that’s pretty great.
    </p>
    <strong>Vetted, stable stdlib</strong>
    <p>
    The Deno community has put together a list of packages modeled after the Go stdlib.
    <a href="https://deno.land/std@0.95.0">Deno stdlib</a>.
    I love this. It means no more searching github for packages or wondering what the latest web
    framework you’re supposed to be using is. The <a href="https://deno.land/std@0.95.0/http">http
    package</a> is a great example.

    <h1>Managers need to do a better job explaining the engineering paths available</h1>

    Every time I leave a job I’m immediately flooded with ideas about how things could’ve been
    improved at the previous company. It’s an interesting phenomenon that can probably be attributed
    to some kind of bias that blinds me while I’m actually working there. Although I always wish I
    had these ideas sooner, I’m able to take them with me to my next workplace so they aren’t
    completely lost to the void. There’s also plenty of time to think in the shower when you’ve been
    laid off.

    I recently started to hit an apex in my career that has made me wonder what comes next. I’ve
    grown the skills in a pillar of software engineering that is enough to land a coding job
    somewhere. I know enough about the languages I use and the problems I’m tasked with that what
    feels like 95% of my time coding has become mundane. This sounds benign and probably a little
    contrived but it has had an effect on my motivation. Work is at its worst when it’s boring, and
    when there’s no foreseeable path forward it feels like a drag. And so, I finally had time to
    think about why I’ve been so burned out the last few years over the span of two jobs — my path
    was not clear.

    It wasn’t until I started looking for my next opportunity that I realized I’ve been ignorant to
    what career paths are available to me. I say ignorant because of course this is all information
    I could have learned on my own at any time. The difference this time was that the jobs I’ve been
    applying to are now staff roles instead of senior SWE roles. I’ve been spending a tremendous
    amount of time reading more about what staff means and it’s truly triggered a resurgence of
    enthusiasm for my own career. I feel like I’ve found a path forward that will challenge me,
    involves skills I haven’t used much, and fills my desire to keep developing software. Your path
    might be totally different; you may find the manager’s path or the senior SWE role a best fit
    for you. My problem was that I had no clue what my next step could be and I was never told what
    my options are. I was pretty surprised to learn just how different a staff or principle engineer
    role is from a senior role at a respectable company, and my experience is that junior engineers
    often feel the same way about senior roles.

    Of the previous half dozen companies I’ve been at I’ve had one manager describe to me the bigger
    picture I should strive for and that was when I was very junior. I know this is company-specific
    and I’m sure this is absolutely not the case at many companies, but I’ve spoken to managers
    who’s direct reports have no idea what they want to do and fellow engineers who think being the
    best coder possible is the end game. One manager I know asked a new direct report what their
    aspirations were and was told that nobody had asked him that before. There are wonderful
    resources that explain how to be a manager, or a CTO, or a staff engineer, but it’s hard to find
    something if you don’t know what you’re looking for.

    It’s in a manager’s best interest to work with their team to help them discover what they want
    to do. You need to do more than ask someone what they want or where they see themselves in X
    years because most times we don’t know. Explain to them the different archetypes of staff
    engineers, the different managerial paths they can aim for, or what it takes to get to a senior
    level of engineering. At a certain point in most engineering careers one starts to think about
    how they can level-up their engineering acumen: side projects, technical books, tech talks, new
    languages. It’s the non-technical skills that are often overlooked: project management,
    documentation, communication, cross-team collaboration. Those might provide a jumping off point
    for discussion around what to work on and, most importantly, why they’re important. It’s worth
    sharing higher level material like [https://www.staffeng.com](https://www.staffeng.com) to show
    them what possibly lies ahead. Get people excited by giving them purpose and a goal to reach
    for. The US Army summarizes the goal of leadership well:

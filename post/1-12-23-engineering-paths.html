    <h1>Managers need to do a better job explaining the engineering paths available</h1>

    <p>
    I recently started to hit a mental ceiling in my career that has made me wonder what comes next.
    I’ve grown my skills in a pillar of software engineering that's enough to land a coding job
    fairly easily, especially in this market (there's still plenty of jobs!). I know enough
    about the languages I use and the problems I’m tasked with that it feels like 95% of my time
    coding has become mundane. This might sound benign and probably a little egotistical but it's
    had a effect on my motivation. I've also noticed others in the same conundrum time and time
    again in our communities: solicitation for advice about getting out of a funk at work, or a
    senior dev's worriment about having to eventually manage people. Work is at its worst when it’s
    boring and when there’s no foreseeable path forward it feels like a drag. And so, I finally had
    time to think about why I’ve been so burned out the last few years over the span of two jobs —
    I had no idea what paths were available.
    </p>
    <p>
    It wasn’t until I started looking for my next opportunity that I realized I’ve been ignorant to
    what career paths are available to me. I say ignorant because of course this is all information
    I could have learned on my own at any time. This interview loop is the first time I've
    considered applying for Staff roles. I’ve been spending a tremendous amount of time reading more
    about what staff means and I was pretty surprised to learn just how different a staff+ role is
    from senior. It’s triggered a resurgence of enthusiasm for my own career. I feel like I’ve found
    a path forward that will challenge me, involves new skills, and fills my desire to keep
    developing software. Your path might be totally different -- you may find the manager’s path or
    the senior SWE role a best fit for you. My problem was that I had no clue what my next step
    could be and I was never told what my options are.

    <p>
    I realized that of the half dozen companies I’ve been at I’ve had one manager describe to me the bigger
    picture I should strive for and that was when I was very junior. I know this is company-specific
    and I’m sure this is absolutely not the case at many companies, but I’ve spoken to managers
    who’s direct reports have no idea what they want to do and fellow engineers who think being the
    best coder possible is the end game. One manager I know asked a new direct report what their
    aspirations were and was told that nobody had asked him that before. There are wonderful
    resources that explain how to be a manager, or a CTO, or a staff engineer, but it’s hard to find
    something if you don’t know what you’re looking for.

    It’s in a manager’s best interest to work with their team to help them discover what they want
    to do. You need to do more than ask someone what they want or where they see themselves in X
    years because most times we don’t know. Explain to them the different archetypes of staff
    engineers, the different managerial paths they can aim for, or what it takes to get to a senior
    level of engineering. At a certain point most software engineers start to think about how they
    can level-up their engineering acumen with side projects, technical books, tech talks, or new
    languages. It’s the non-technical skills that are often overlooked: project management,
    documentation, communication, cross-team collaboration. Those might provide a jumping off point
    for discussion around what to work on and, most importantly, why they’re important. It’s worth
    sharing higher level material like <a

  ahead. Get people excited by giving them purpose and a goal to reach for. The US Army summarizes
  the goal of leadership well:

    Leadership is the activity of influencing people by providing purpose, direction, and motivation
    to accomplish the mission and improve the organization. (<a
